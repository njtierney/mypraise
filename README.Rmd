```{r setup, include = FALSE}

# praiseme

The goal of praiseme is to deliver to praise to people!

## Installation

```{r installation-instructions, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("njtierney/mypraise")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(praiseme)
praise()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.
